# Finding Waldo - a 'Where's Waldo' neural network with object localization
A CNN paired with a sliding window algorithim that can locate Waldo in 'Where's Waldo' images.
The Waldo-notebook has all the code and a gentle walkthrough of running it.
For a light-hearted look at the project, check out the blog pdf I made!

WaldosToCut and WaldolessToCut are the source images I use to generate my dataset. Warning: they were compressed when I zipped and uploaded them, so you might get different training results.

Waldo Full Images are some puzzles you can use test the network/sliding window on. It is a mixed bag: some are very low quality and will not work with the netowrk, while some are high resolution and work fantastically. I just wanted to provide some images so you do not have to spend time finding your own :)
