# Finding Waldo - a 'Where's Waldo' neural network with object localization
A CNN paired with a sliding window algorithim that can locate Waldo in 'Where's Waldo' images.
The Waldo-notebook has all the code and a gentle walkthrough of running it.
For a light-hearted look at the project, check out the blog pdf I made!

WaldosToCut and WaldolessToCut are the source images I use to generate my dataset. Warning: they were compressed when I zipped and uploaded them, so you might get different training results.
